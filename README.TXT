How I manipulated the original image

1) I thought everything looked better in grayscale so I made the entire thing grayscale
2) I made a vertical and horizontal mirror method
3) I made a rotate and negation method
4) Obviously made the original recursive method

Put each of these next to each other to form the collage you see today.
